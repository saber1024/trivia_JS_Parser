# Trivial Javascript Parser

This project is used for study parser, the code might be variant from time to time.

The code is mostly based on javascript, however, I may add some of my personal habits to it.

Right now the code can parse the following syntax:

- Statement like `a + b `
- Variant declaration like `let a = 4;`
- Function declaration `func foo() {}` and function call `foo()`
- control flow like while、for、do-while
- Class declaration and initialize
